# upload_file_python
Uploading files using Python and Flask

This is a simple python script to upload file or files to server using Flask.
The script lacks CSS and styling features as it is meant for illustration and getting started purposes

Update:
app_display_image.py: is updated code to display uploaded images.
Usage: Change the html file in templates folder to complete.html.

This update is best complemented with the video tutorial in my channel here: https://youtu.be/Y2fMCxLz6wM
